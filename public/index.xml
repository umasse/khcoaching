      <description>My daughter painted this tree when she was about 10 years old. What is unusual about it, is that she&amp;rsquo;s given the root system just as much attention and space as the part of the tree most of us draw when we think of a &amp;ldquo;tree&amp;rdquo;.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been having conversations with clients and other people about what growth means for them. This has made me think even more about my own definition of growth.</description>

      <description>As a third culture kid - now adult - my survival strategy was to adapt. Adapt to the local surroundings, blend in, do as the Romans do. The &amp;ldquo;chameleon&amp;rdquo; strategy. It has served me well.
But now, after having left the familiar comfort zone of teaching and counselling, I&amp;rsquo;m having to come up with a new &amp;ldquo;survival&amp;rdquo; mechanism. It&amp;rsquo;s no longer about blending in, and not really about surviving, but about thriving.</description>

      <description>You are a leader who is: Growth-oriented, idealistic, and mission-driven. In some personal and/or professional transition. Committed to personal and professional growth, but have reached the limits of what you can do by yourself. Feeling stuck in certain areas, “busy”, reactive, stressed, or lacking direction, joy and inspiration. Struggling to focus on the bigger picture, your purpose. Giving your best self to work, but lacking presence at home. Ready to work on mental patterns and behaviours that no longer serve you and find a deep level of contentment and calm within, no matter what is going on around you.</description>

      <description>I experienced burnout due to a combination of personal and professional circumstances during a major international move and career change. I lost confidence in my skills and abilities, and my mind and body became ruled by fear, panic and negative self talk.
My main doubt about coaching with Karin was my ability to make the time and monetary commitment for it, but I discovered that my job was able to support me on both fronts.</description>
