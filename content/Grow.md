<h5 class="">Coaching is Right for You if You Are:</h5>

A high-achieving, experienced educator.

Going through a stressful career or life transition.

Committed to growth, but have reached the limits of what you can do by yourself.

Feeling stuck in certain areas, “busy”, reactive, stressed, or lacking joy and inspiration.

Struggling to focus on the bigger picture, your purpose, the school's vision.

Giving your best self to work, but lacking presence at home.

Missing someone with whom you can process your own thinking - it can be lonely being a leader.

              At work and home I stepped aside to look at my behavioural patterns from a  more distant but friendly perspective, I learnt how the saboteurs work and how they are in the way of a healthy lifestyle. Also, having empathy for others and their own saboteurs made me feel much more forgiving and connected with others.

I didn’t realize how much I had changed, how I was doing things that weren’t good for me. I am back to the Christy I used to be. I feel strong in myself. I feel confident.
