* Growth-oriented, idealistic, and mission-driven.
* In some personal and/or professional transition.
* Committed to personal and professional growth, but have reached the limits of what you can do by yourself.
* Feeling stuck in certain areas, “busy”, reactive, stressed, or lacking direction, joy and inspiration. 
* Struggling to focus on the bigger picture, your purpose.
* Giving your best self to work, but lacking presence at home. 
* Ready to work on mental patterns and behaviours that no longer serve you and find a deep level of contentment and calm within, no matter what is going on around you. 
* Missing someone with whom you can talk to and process your own thinking with - it can be lonely being a leader.
* Ready to be vulnerable, honest, take risks, take action, have serious conversations, but also laugh and be light.
* Wanting to go from being a good leader to a great leader!

> After 2 years of covid, instead of looking forward to going back to the old routine I was dreading it. I realized that I wasn't happy with some aspects of my life, and felt like maybe this was going to be the way it was going to be for the rest of my life: not particularly happy but semi comfortably with how things were. The way I saw it, this was a middle-age crisis. Should I try to change something? My circumstances? Myself? Or just hold on and see.

Your transition might be
* Moving countries or repatriating 
* Taking on a new position
* Making a career change
* Going through a separation/divorce
* Questioning your midlife path
* or a combination of the above

Transitions can be a time of turmoil, feeling out of your comfort zone, uncertainty and overwhelm, but they also can be a time of courage, excitement, adventure, re-aligning your life with your values, finding yourself again, and an opportunity to build something new, something better. 

Transitions, however unsettling they can be, are the perfect opportunity to grow as individuals and as leaders.

> Just by taking the time to talk about my issues with someone else, in an honest and open way, with the shared goal of trying to find solutions, you start seeing things differently. And where I couldn't see a solution, having an outsider's perspective focused on helping you find it was extremely helpful.
I started on my new job, a job that checks boxes that I wouldn't have contemplated if it wasn't for Karin.
