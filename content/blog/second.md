<img src="/images/karin/posts/tree.jpg" class="is-pulled-left mr-5 is-3 column"> My daughter painted this tree when she was about 10 years old.
What is unusual about it, is that she's given the root system just as much attention and space as the part of the tree most of us draw when we think of a "tree".

I've been having conversations with clients and other people about what growth means for them. This has made me think even more about my own definition of growth. Years later - my daughter now 13 - I realise that she has actually visually represented, the way I see growth.

The trigger for looking for a visual representation of my definition, was actually a post about growth, showing all these different graphs. (I reposted it, so you can find it in my feed).

I believe that in order to grow professionally, we need to grow personally. But not in a "I'm at the bottom, I need to go to the top" kind of way.

But by creating a solid foundation for ourselves (our roots), in the form of proper self-care (nutrition, exercise, sleep, relaxation, fun, connection with others, our own bodies, with nature, self-love). Without this foundation and deep root system, when life's challenges come our way, we are more likely to topple over or just "survive" instead of grow.

Once you have the foundation (and we're always growing this, it's dynamic, our needs change with the seasons and the years), you've created the optimal conditions for growth to happen. Then you can start to fulfil your purpose, pursue your passion, live your mission, deal with challenges and setbacks. So grow whatever grounds you, so that you can thrive.

What are your definitions of growth?

How would you represent it visually?
