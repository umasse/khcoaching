As a third culture kid - now adult - my survival strategy was to adapt. Adapt to the local surroundings, blend in, do as the Romans do. The "chameleon" strategy. It has served me well.

But now, after having left the familiar comfort zone of teaching and counselling, I'm having to come up with a new "survival" mechanism. It's no longer about blending in, and not really about surviving, but about thriving. It's about finding my voice as a coach, being authentic to who I am, my style, my passion, my purpose. It's a bit like having a blank canvas and thinking about which colors are MINE. Not the colors I need to blend in to my surroundings anymore.

<img src="/images/karen/posts/pie.png" class="is-pulled-left mr-5">I feel like a chameleon who's gone from green camouflage to daring to show my bright colours and spots.

So yesterday, I went shopping and bought the brightest, most colourful blazer ever. I hadn't picked it out myself. The sales woman handed it to me and said I should try it. I thought, really?? This? Definitely not my usual style, but ok. I put it on and ... I felt so HAPPY! It made me feel playful and powerful at the same time.

When I got home and showed my teenage daughter, she was horrified. Mom, that's TOO bright! Yes, it is. But I love it. And if I can let go of what others will think, I am going to wear it.

I'm done blending in, and it makes ME happy!

So if you're a relatively new leader, or find yourself in a new leadership experience, and are thinking a lot about your own leadership style, how much do you adapt - which is important and fine - but also, how much of YOU, are you going to add to the mix?
What are your authentic colors? What do you represent? How do you want to feel? Which parts of you are you holding back?
