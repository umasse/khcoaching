* **Coaching is time and space dedicated to processing your thoughts** and feelings with a non-judgemental, caring, thinking parter: me!
* **We challenge beliefs** and discover different perspectives, so that you come up with **your own insights**, action steps and solutions.
* **Coaching saves you time and energy** in the long run - it reduces ruminations and indecisiveness while improving your clarity of mind and confidence in decision-making.
* My coaching helps you **grow personally and professionally**.

PQ has given me a simple and incredibly effective way to tap into this knowledge, be present and feel happy and calm. It's so simple and it works!
