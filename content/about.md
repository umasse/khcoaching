* **Coaching is time and space dedicated to processing your thoughts** and feelings with a non-judgemental, caring, thinking parter: me!
* **We challenge beliefs** and discover different perspectives, so that you come up with **your own insights**, action steps and solutions.
* **Coaching saves you time and energy** in the long run - it reduces ruminations and indecisiveness while improving your clarity of mind and confidence in decision-making.
* My coaching helps you **grow personally and professionally**.

                I didn’t believe it at first, but the saboteurs are very real! If something is feeling difficult, there is a saboteur involved. Knowing how to calm yourself down, and realizing when you’ve been sabotaged, that self-awareness is invaluable. I apply it to all aspects in my life.
