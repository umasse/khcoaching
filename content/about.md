<h1>Grow Yourself to Grow Your Vision</h1>

I help leaders feel less overwhelmed and more in control so that they can grow their vision for their lives and for their institutions


<h5 class="secondary h5 is-secondary">In a nutshell, I am:</h5>

* **Curious** - About the world, people, myself, how humans think, feel and behave.
* **Passionate** - About sustainability, justice and equity, diversity, coaching, education, health.
* **Caring** - I’m very empathetic, supporting others has always been my calling.
* **Growth-oriented** - I love learning, and I constantly look for ways to improve and challenge myself
* **Risk-taker** - I follow my passion despite the challenges

* Coaching is time and space completely dedicated to processing your thoughts and feelings with a non-judgemental, caring, thinking parter, me!
* We challenge beliefs, “truths”, and come up with different perspectives so that you come up with your own insights, action steps and solutions.
* Coaching saves you time and energy in the long run - it cuts down on the ruminations, the indecisiveness, you improve your clarity of mind, focus, and confidence in decision-making.
* My coaching helps you GROW personally and professionally.
